'''The playing algorithm is very simple. Once the user chooses the level 
theyâ€™d like to play a list of the appropriate size is made and populated as 
the user makes guesses and the computer checks these against the code. 
The pruning strategy uses a list (states) of all 6^4 = 1296 possible guesses 
in the game and as the user makes guesses this list is pruned to exclude 
impossible codes based on the results of the users guess. The pruning strategy 
uses the fact that the result of checkmove(guess, code) = checkmove(code, 
guess) so for a guess, the states list can be traversed and compare each 
state checkmove(state, guess) with checkmove(guess, code). If checkmove(state, 
guess) == checkmove(guess, code) it is possible that the state is the code, 
if not we can remove that state from the list of possible codes. 
The minimax algorithm uses the fact that every given result for checkmove(a, 
b) is unique so when all 1296 potstates are checked against any given state 
in the already pruned list, they can be broken into 14 disjoint groups. The 
choice for the best state to guess next is the state which gives the smallest 
maximum size of these disjoint groups since the worst case scenario (that the 
answer is in the biggest of these disjoint groups) is the smallest group.'''
